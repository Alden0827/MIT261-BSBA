in reports use tables and charts 


Reports:

A. Student Performance Analytics

Top Performers – Identify the top 10 students with the highest average grades per semester and per school year, per course and per year level; sort results in descending order.
Failing Students – List students who failed more than 30% of their enrolled subjects; sort results in descending order.
Students with Grade Improvement – Detect students whose grades improved over time.
Distribution of Grades – Create a histogram of grades (60–100) and determine the most common range (e.g., 60–69, 70–79, 80–89, 90–100).

B. Subject and Teacher Analytics

Hardest Subject – Find the subjects with the largest failure rate. For each subject, calculate the percentage of failure.
Easiest Subjects – Subjects with the highest proportion of grades ≥ 90.
Average Grades per Teacher – Average grades per teacher across all semesters.
Teachers with High Failures – Teachers with highest number of failures per semester.

C. Course and Curriculum Insights

Grade Trend per Course – Is average grade increasing or decreasing by year for BSCS, BSEE, and BSIT?
Subject Load Intensity – Average units taken per student per semester, grouped by course.
General Education vs. Major Subjects Performance – Compare student performance in GE vs. Major subjects.

D. Semester and Academic Year Analysis

Semester with Lowest Average Grade – Find which semester had the lowest GPA across all students.
Best Performing Semester – Highest overall GPA.
Grade Deviation Across Semesters – Identify subjects where grade variance is high across semesters.

E. Student Demographics and Behavior

Year Level Distribution – How many students in each year level?
Student Count per Course – Number of BSCS, BSEE, and BSIT enrolled students.
Performance by Year Level – Average grades per year level.
